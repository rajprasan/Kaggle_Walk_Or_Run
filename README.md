# Kaggle_Walk_Or_Run
This is Python code (different classification algorithms) to compare performance on same dataset
Basically used logistic regression, decision tree and random forest (combined with classification report and confusion matrix). 
Note there are opportunities to improve this model by downselecting key features having impact on the final outcome (p-value <0.05) which will upgraded shortly
